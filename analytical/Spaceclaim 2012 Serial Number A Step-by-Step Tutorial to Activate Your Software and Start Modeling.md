## How to Use SpaceClaim 2012 for 3D Modeling
 
SpaceClaim 2012 is a software that is designed to make 3D modeling easy and fun. You can use SpaceClaim 2012 to create models from scratch or edit existing models from other sources. You can also use SpaceClaim 2012 to repair models that have errors or gaps. Here are some steps on how to use SpaceClaim 2012 for 3D modeling:
 
1. Launch SpaceClaim 2012 and choose a template or a blank document. You can also open an existing model from your computer or from the internet.
2. Use the toolbar on the left side of the screen to access various tools and commands. You can also use the right-click menu or the keyboard shortcuts to perform actions.
3. Use the pull tool to create or modify geometry. You can drag faces, edges, or vertices to change their shape, size, or position. You can also use the pull tool to create new features, such as extrusions, revolutions, sweeps, or lofts.
4. Use the move tool to translate, rotate, or scale geometry. You can also use the move tool to align, copy, or mirror geometry.
5. Use the fill tool to close gaps or holes in your model. You can also use the fill tool to smooth or simplify geometry.
6. Use the combine tool to merge or subtract geometry. You can also use the combine tool to split or intersect geometry.
7. Use the sketch tool to draw 2D shapes on a plane or a face. You can also use the sketch tool to edit existing sketches or convert them into 3D geometry.
8. Use the dimension tool to add measurements and constraints to your model. You can also use the dimension tool to edit existing dimensions or delete them.
9. Use the annotation tool to add text, symbols, or images to your model. You can also use the annotation tool to edit existing annotations or delete them.
10. Use the view tool to change the perspective, orientation, or display mode of your model. You can also use the view tool to zoom, pan, or rotate your model.

These are some of the basic tools and commands that you can use in SpaceClaim 2012. You can explore more features and options by using the help menu or the online tutorials. You can also customize your workspace and preferences by using the options menu.
